I think you're my second person who i ever minta maaf like this.  But you're the first person who i ever code a website for. Aku ni jenis orng ynv tknk mintak maaf, but if i do you're very special to me, like really reallyyyy special. You're my first experience in friendship. Dah tu je lah, banyak sangat yapping. Nanti ko stress pulak kann. Dah, sorryyyyyyy

hey,idk lah why i wanted to add a new line. Im doing this at 2am almost 3 actually, learning to code a little and my mood is kinda, bad? or what lah idk. Just want to say,I really appreciate you as my bsf. You're like, my answered prayer and I hope you are. <br> Yk, when i was f1, i was really struggling w/ friendship, i have no one. And, in one random night, i was crying, I prayed to God, asking for a friendship that last forever, I ask for a bsf who truly love me,truly care about me. idc about looks, economy or whatever, just want a true friend. And yeah, we randomly get close and I love it. Even tho i dont like u when we first met, but as we get closer, my mind slowly turing 180 degrees. <br> <br>I hope we stay friend forever unless its God's plan to separate us. Youre my first ever friend who made me feel loved. Sorry if I treated you bad or what, Im really sorry. Im sorry if some of my words hurts your feelings, i never meant to. Sorry if I annoyed you.I know u never see this, thats why i write it here. I have two a copy of this web and this is the copy, the original one was the one i sent to u. Same file name just different acc. Mehhhh, im keeping this for myself. Just in case when we're not friend anymore, i can read tis whole shit again to remind me how much friendship actually killing me.

   <div class="para">
Tbh, I dont think we're going to stay friend forever even tho I really hope we would stay forever. Idk why but, setiap kali aku kawan dgn bongsu and lebih tua dri aku (tua bulan), mesti mereka akan jadi bsf aku. But, always leave too. So aku rasa you'll be one of them. You'll leave me too one day, and I'm sure about it. Walaupun aku tau ianya akan terjadi and ik i should leave first but, I just want to spend more time w/ u before it actually happend. AlangÂ² juga aku nk pindah. Oh yah, that "pindah" actually remind me of something. Semua friendship aku dengan bongsu always end sebab aku pindah. Tak kesah lah pindah school, negeri or kelas, asalkan pindah. So I think lepas aku pindah nanti, we will become stranger again. Haha. I could never imagine a whole year of school w/out you. Idk if I can ever move on from our friendship if it really ends. Idk why I was yapping instead of actually learning how to code.Idk lah, I think I was just distracted by you repost maybe. I write this whole shit after I watch you repost btw. Hmmm, doesnt make any sense. nyamnyamnyam., i need to focus on coding, its 3:27 rn. </div>

   <div class="para"> 
Everyone's sleeping. Idk, I just cant sleep tonight. Kinda need to clear my mind. I want to go out so bad. Just laying on the road, watching the stars or take a walk, jogging maybe. But yeah, CCTV's on, my parents gonna know. Its very quite now, I love it. Actually I like being alone but not in
school or events. Yk, the main reason aku jalan kaki datang & balik sekolah is that i can talk to myself. Like just imagining someone was walking w/ me and having deep conversation or vent every pain in my chest. Talking to myself were my favourite hobby. Its fun in any possible way. Sometimes I do pray while walking, talk to God, talking about what happend in my life, talking about people I love to Him, its kinda heals me bc I was talking to someone who is real and not just my imagination and that someone who is really love and care about me. Even tho I dont go to church really often but I do pray everyday, atleast twice a day. I even pray for those who I love, you're one of them btw. Im not that close to God actually, I swear alot, you know it. But I really want to change that, I dont want to swear that much, I dont want to be toxic. I want to change that behavio but idk how. Maybe I need someone to tegur me whenever i was swearing. Haihhhh, but idk how to find one. Yah idk. I just realise im not yapping at the web im supose to yap at. Fyi, a made web for me to yap to 'someone'. I put the web name as their name and just yap whatever I want to yap to them. I didnt make that much web. Some are just my drafts, some are just for experiments. I actually have a web that I put your name as the name of the web. Yeah, its have many shits in it. Just bunch of my yapping. You see this whole paragraph? In that website i have more than 10 of these. I was making a coding project actually, it was in my main acc of Github and its in private rn. That all lah, i wasnt supposed to yap here. I'll change web, babai.
